# Word Counter

Kata for finding the top 100 most frequently occurring words, excluding stop words, in a text file. Runs in `M + E + (M-E)log(M-E)` time. Written in Typescript, Express, and the Preact web framework. An exercise in "Red, Green, Refactor".

Created from a template of mine: [preact-express-starter](https://github.com/bmitchinson/preact-express-starter)

Completed in a few hours on a Sunday afternoon.

## Demo - [Link]()

This repo has been deployed onto heroku. The .txt files used in the word counting
process were adapted from provided PDF files, converted on [zamzar.com](zamzar.com)
to .txt

## How it works

-   Read Exclude list into object (E)
    -   stored as object (functions as a "hashset"), for O(1) lookups later
-   Read in MD text file into WordCounter. (M)
    -   Iterate each word of MD, Increment counts of each word into a map
    -   If included in exclude map, skip
-   Sort all values of WordCounter ((M-E)Log(M-E))
    -   Use JS `.sort` for max efficiency (Likely [Timsort](https://v8.dev/blog/array-sort#timsort))

Runtime: `M + E + (M-E)log(M-E)`

## Notes

-   Why preact over react? - [link](https://preactjs.com/)
-   Files can be swapped out by changing the path in `textfiles.ts`. Future
    improvement would to be including file upload.

## CLI Commands

Run with Node v16.14.0

-   `npm run preact:build`: Production-ready build for the preact app.

-   `npm start`: Startup the express server that serves the preact app.

## Improvements and Reflection

-   How could this be made faster?
    -   ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
-   How could this be memory optimized?
    -   Reading in the files uses twice the needed memory (filestream + itâ€™s contents as a map)
        -   [https://geshan.com.np/blog/2021/10/nodejs-read-file-line-by-line/#readline](https://geshan.com.np/blog/2021/10/nodejs-read-file-line-by-line/#readline) readline uses less memory
    -   Spreading the map into an array to sort in `wordRanker` creates another new copy of the word counts in memory, maybe thereâ€™s a way to sort the map in place?
-   How could code quality be improved.
    -   I was disappointed to notice at the end that typescript isnâ€™t complaining about missing class parameters, despite being in strict mode and having parameters defined in an interface with mandatory properties. Validating class parameters could look something like this: [Nozzle Gear Blog](https://nozzlegear.com/blog/build-a-simple-object-validation-utility-with-typescript)
-   Edge cases
    -   The prompt asks for explicitly 100 results so, iâ€™ve chosen to exclude ties that exceed 100. The result is sorted primarily by occurrence, and secondarily in alphabetical order.
        -   If ties were preferred to be returned, potentially surpassing the 100 count specification, there could be a check for entries that share the top 100 lowest value, to include them in the reported results.
-   Git
    -   At one point I refactored and in the process added some functionality to `loadFile`. I was resistant to test it because data was coming in from a file, and I was testing its effects by testing classes that utilized `loadFile`. I should have handled that resistance to test by breaking up the logic to accept strings, to make unit testing things like punctuation and number removal more accessible.
        -   Upon running the code with real data, I realized these improvements needed to be properly tested, and test drove their additions.
    -   Seems like too many commits. Could argue I was a bit too granular on committing a test at a time, could have filled in a few at once and still fulfilled red green refactor.
