# Word Counter

Kata for finding the top 100 most frequently occurring words, excluding stop words, in a text file. Runs in `M + E + (M-E)log(M-E)` time. Written in Typescript and the Preact web framework. An exercise in "Red, Green, Refactor".

## How it works

-   Read Exclude list into object (E)
    -   stored as object (functions as a "hashset"), for O(1) lookups later
-   Read in MD text file into WordCounter. (M)
    -   Iterate each word of MD, Increment counts of each word into a map
    -   If included in exclude map, skip
-   Sort all values of WordCounter ((M-E)Log(M-E))
    -   Use JS `.sort` for max efficiency (Likely [Timsort](https://v8.dev/blog/array-sort#timsort))

Runtime: `M + E + (M-E)log(M-E)`

## Notes

-   Why preact over react? - [link](https://preactjs.com/)

## Improvements

-   How could this be made faster?

-   How could this be memory optimized?
    -   Reading in the files uses twice the needed memory (filestream + itâ€™s contents as a map)
